                <span class="content">First of all, the line took hours and I didn't know why when I was literally going to be the next one on the cash register. After I got my order, it really took more than an hour for your crew to prep me a meal. Also, the wait wasn't worth it, imagine waiting for around an hour for a dry hotdog???</span>
